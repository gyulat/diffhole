# diffhole

Diffraction through pinholes
============================

GUI app that generates beautiful diffraction patterns

Inspired by:
http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/733754/visually-stunning-math-concepts-which-are-easy-to-explain
(see no.36):
"Fourier transform of the light intensity due to a diffraction pattern caused by light going through 
 8 pinholes and interfering on a wall"
